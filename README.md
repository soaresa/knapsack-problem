# Knapsack Problem

This project was created to solve a combinatorial problem known as 1/0 Knapsack Problem. As an NP-complete problem there is no known solution that is fast and correct for all cases. So I want to implement a simple one and an optimized one which allows me to solve a combinatorial problem with large data on my personal computer.
